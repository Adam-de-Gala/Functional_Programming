# Functional_Programming
A program in racket (functional paradigm) language to process a context free programming language. 
Written for my "Principals of Programming Languages" course at Iowa State.  

The production rules for the context free language are in the PDF.
The context free language has about the equivalent power of C. 
It has variables, functions and pointers.
